# Sqeleton
This repository is a simple module for simulating quantum computer.  
sqeleton is a very short about 100 lines.  
sqeleton has minimum functions such as QuantumState(state vector), QuantumCircuit(1q-gate(pauli,H,T) and 2q-gate(CNOT)).

# Feature
Easy to understand(100~lines python) and support to understand how recently quantum computer simulator libraries are built by reading sqeleton code.   
sqeleton has simulator core logic.


# Requirement
* numpy

# Usage
clone sqeleton.py from this repository and import it.  
usage.py is a simple example file for how to use this simulator.   

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serowri/sqeleton.git
cd sqeleton
python usage.py
```

# Note
sqeleton is so short and simple that lack precision(especially calculation results).  
sqeleton is very slow.
